# Unsupervized-learning

Unsupervised learning is a set of statistical tools for scenarios in which there is only a set of features and no labels. Therefore, we cannot make predictions since there are no associated responses to each observation. Instead, we are interested in finding way to visualize data or in discovering subgroups of similar observations.

Unsupervised learning tends to be more challenging because there is no clear objective for the analysis, and it is often subjective. Additionally, it is hard to assess if the obtained results are good, since there is no accepted mechanism for performing cross-validation or validating results on an independent dataset, because we do not know the true answer.

Clustering refers to a broad set of techniques for finding subgroups or clusters in a dataset. This helps us partition observations into distinct groups so that each group contains observations that are like each other. There are many clustering methods and we will Introduced several of them. My goal is to shift from theoretical point of view to a practical manner by implementing and examining several algorithms.
